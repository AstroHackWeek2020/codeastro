    "## Numpy and Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is a powerful numeric library that is essential for anyone analyzing data with Python. Numpy is a huge package that can support a multitude of tasks. Numpy is also inextricably linked to SciPy, a powerful library for scientific computing with capabilities for fitting, linear algebra, machine learning, etc. Here we are just going to cover some of the basics of numpy, but I encourage you to check out the numpy documentation pages (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) to get an idea of the variety of things you can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are a data type which is fundamental to Numpy. In some ways Numpy arrays are like Python lists:\n",
    "    - both are used for storing data/objects\n",
    "    - both are mutable\n",
    "    - items can be extracted from both using indexing and slicing\n",
    "    - both can be iterated over\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are key aspects of arrays that make them very different:\n",
    "    - most operators act on the elements of an array instead of the array as a whole\n",
    "    - arrays can only hold data of a single type\n",
    "    - arrays can efficiently store large amounts of data in memory\n"
