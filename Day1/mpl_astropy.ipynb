    "- **Don't overengineer your plotting code.** This means you don't need to add a million keywords anticipating every possible tweak your users might wish to make. Focus on making it easy for your users to modify the code themselves. Make sure you return `Figure` and `Axes` objects (more on this below) to your user so they can easily modify plots.\n",
    "- **Apply principles of good design.** This means using color palettes with lots of contrast, making your fonts large and easy-to-read, and making sure your plots are colorblind friendly. (There are several great colorblindness simulators out there, for example [this one](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/).) It's also good to differentiate plot elements in more than one way (ex: one line is black and dashed, another is red and solid). \n",
