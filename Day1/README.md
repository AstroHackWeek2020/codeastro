# Day 1

## Project Goal for Today:

Decide on the purpose of the package. Write one central function or class. 

Example: weâ€™re working on a package that plots the most likely galactic orbits for a user-specified subset of the Gaia catalog. Today, me and partner 1 will write a function that uses `galpy` to compute and plot orbits for a list of stars, and partners 2 and 3 will write a class for constructing the list of stars using user input.

## Learning Objectives

  * Identify which development environment is most appropriate for their programming task.
  * Decide when and how to design software using functional and object oriented paradigms.
  * Employ best practices for using numpy, pandas, matplotlib & astropy in open-source packages, and explain the purposes of each of these packages.
