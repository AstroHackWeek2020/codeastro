# Getting Started

If you are using a Windows machine, first check out the setup instructions 
[here](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/blob/master/Day0/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md). Once you've
followed those instructions, come back and continue here.

We'll use miniconda to install Python and necessary packages. You can download and install
miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Once you've installed miniconda, install the Python packages listed in our 
[requirements.txt](https://github.com/semaphoreP/codeastro/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.
If you clone this repository onto your local machine, you can do this using the command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You can also install the packages one-by-one by typing, for example:

    pip install numpy
