    "Generally, it is important to focus your effort on speeding up the 1 or 2 slowest functions. If you speed up something that takes 50% of the runtime by a factor of 100, you speed up the code by a factor of 2. Even if a piece of code takes 10% of the runtime, a factor of 2 improvement (which by itself is often hard to get) only gives you a 5% improvement in the end. **Focus your effort on optimizing the runtime of the one or two functions that take the most amount of time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For all else, it is generally more important to optimize code readibility over runtime. Code that is more readible is less prone to bugs and eaiser to maintain. If a piece of code takes only 0.0001% of the runtime, any amount of speed up is not worth making the code hard to read (from a person-hour perspective). Many times, it is difficult to gain more than a factor of 2 speed up in runtime. Definitely think about the potential gain in speed-up versus how long it takes to write and maintian the code.\n",

    "If you identified the critical chunk of code to speed up, the general strategy is to remove unncessary computations as much as possible. There's unfortunately not one single method to speed up your code. But here are a few ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Eliminate computations that are not being used (e.g., computing variables you do not use; processing parts of images that will be discarded). \n",
    "2. Use `numpy` functions whenever possible for matrix operations\n",
    "3. Avoid using python `for` and `while` loops as they are slow\n",
    "4. If MKL/BLAS is being run inside of already-parallelized code, disable MKL/BLAS.\n",
    "5. Reduce the number of iterations or increase the tolerance of routines that are unncessarily precise (e.g., optimizers can run for less iterations; sin and cos can be approximated by taylor expansions). \n"
