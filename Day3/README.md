# Day 3

## Project Goal:

Document your code and put it on pypi to make it pip installable.

Example: we’ll write docstrings for each of our classes and functions, and put the code on pypi. We’ll try pip installing it on each of our machines to work through installation problems.

## Learning Objectives

  * Be able to use docstrings and sphinx to document code for others to use
  * Profile the run time of your code and identify the computational bottlenecks
  * Set up and release Python packages publicly
