# Program Description

​Code/Astro is a week-long astronomy software development bootcamp. The goal of this program is to teach students fundamental software engineering skills and best practices for building sustainable open-source packages for astronomy applications. The workshop will also serve as a networking and career development opportunity. Due to the current pandenmic, the inaugural Code/Astro will be held remotely. Code/Astro is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

### Dates

### Instructors

 * Jason Wang (Caltech)
 * Sarah Blunt (Caltech)
 * BJ Fulton (IPAC)

# ​Schedule

During the bootcamp, students will obtain hands-on experience with software engineering by developing a software package from scratch. The daily schedule will consist of classes in the mornings and time to work on individual projects in the afternoons. Topics covered each day are as follows:

| Monday 6/22   | Tuesday 6/23  | Wednesday 6/24  | Thursday 6/25  | Friday 6/26   |

# How to Apply

The workshop will be held remotely via Zoom each day. Structured activities will occur from 9am-noon (PDT) each day. The rest of the time is unstructured and participants can work on their packages at their own pace. 

We require participants to be familiar with Python or another high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Matlab) as this bootcamp will not be teaching the basics of programming. Students are expected to develop on their own computers and have set up their development environment there. The workshop will be held online via video conferencing. For students that require financial assistance in any way to participate, please contact Jason Wang (jwang4@caltech.edu), as we have some funding support available. Anyone related to astronomy is eligible.
