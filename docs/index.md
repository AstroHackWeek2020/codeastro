# Program Description

​Code/Astro is a week-long astronomy software development bootcamp for undergraduates at Caltech. The goal of this program is to teach students fundamental software engineering skills and best practices for building sustainable open-source packages for astronomy applications. The workshop will also serve as a networking and career development opportunity. Code/Astro is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

### Dates
6/22/2020 - 6/26/2020

### Instructors

 * Jason Wang (Caltech)
 * Sarah Blunt (Caltech)
 * BJ Fulton (IPAC)
 * Erik Petigura (UCLA)

# ​Schedule

During the bootcamp, students will obtain hands-on experience with software engineering by developing a software package from scratch. The daily schedule will consist of classes in the mornings and time to work on individual projects in the afternoons. Topics covered each day are as follows:

| Monday 6/22   | Tuesday 6/23  | Wednesday 6/24  | Thursday 6/25  | Friday 6/26   |

# How to Apply

The workshop will be held at Caltech in Pasadena, CA and participants will be responsible for their own transportation and housing costs. For that reason, the workshop is targeted students who will already doing research at Caltech or JPL through the Caltech SURF program. It is not necessary to be a US citizen; international students are welcome to apply.

We require students to be familiar with Python or another high-level programming language (e.g., Java, Matlab) as this bootcamp will not be teaching the basics of programming. Students are expected to develop on their own computers and have set up their development environment there.
